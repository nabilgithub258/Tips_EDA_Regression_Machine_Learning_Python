# Seaborn Tips Dataset Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks analyzing the "tips" dataset using Seaborn. The tips dataset is a widely-used dataset in the field of data visualization and is included in the Seaborn library for demonstration purposes.

## Overview

The project includes:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilizing Seaborn to visualize relationships between variables such as total bill, tip amount, and dining time.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Basic statistical summaries and hypothesis testing related to the tips dataset.
- **Visualization:** Various plots including scatter plots, histograms, and categorical plots to understand patterns in the data.
- 
## Requirements

To run the scripts and notebooks in this repository, ensure you have:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for viewing and interacting with the notebooks)

Additional Python libraries required:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy

Install the necessary libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please create an issue or a pull request in this repository.

## Update

We conducted an analysis to predict the tips given by customers using regression models. We implemented linear regression and random forest algorithms, and further enhanced our models by incorporating GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters. Our most successful model combined random forest with GridSearchCV, yielding the best predictive performance.

While the primary purpose of this tips dataset is not typically for prediction or modeling, we took on this challenge to test and refine our skills.
